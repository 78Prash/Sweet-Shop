🤖 My AI Usage
I used AI tools (ChatGPT) to:

Understand Spring Boot + Spring Security configuration
Debug authentication and redirect loop issues
Generate sample JUnit & Mockito test cases
Improve README structure and documentation clarity
All business logic, integration, debugging, and final implementation were reviewed, modified, and implemented by me.

AI was used strictly as an assistant, not as a replacement for learning.

🔐 Authentication & Authorization
Authentication implemented using Spring Security (Session-based)
Form login with username & password
Roles supported:
ROLE_ADMIN
ROLE_USER
Access Control:
Admin: Add / Edit / Delete sweets
User: View & Purchase sweets
Note: JWT-based authentication can be added as a future enhancement.
